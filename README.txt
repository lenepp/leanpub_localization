What This Is
################

We're trying to make Leanpub landing pages and purchase pages available in as many languages as possible. That way, if you write a book in a particular language, you can also present it to customers and sell it in the same language.

If you'd like to help us out, you can contribute by adding new translations or fixing existing translations.

Language files have a two-letter language code followed by the .yml extension. Thus the English file is en.yml and the Portuguese file is pt.yml. If your language isn't represented here, let us know and we'll add a file for you.
